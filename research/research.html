      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My research focuses on the physics of <strong>multiphase flows</strong>, with applications in energy transport, industrial systems, and environmental fluid mechanics. I study flows where multiple fluid or solid phases interact — such as gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, or solid-fluid systems — under complex boundary conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work integrates <strong>experiments, data analysis, and theoretical modeling</strong> to understand instabilities, transitions, and transport mechanisms in these systems. I'm particularly interested in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transient and steady-state behavior in stratified and dispersed flows</li>
        <li>Interfacial instabilities and wave formation</li>
        <li>High-pressure CO₂ transport relevant to CCS pipelines</li>
        <li>Dry ice formation and phase transition dynamics during blowdown</li>
        <li>Heat and mass transfer in multiphase systems</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Current Projects</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently working on two projects at the intersection of experimental fluid mechanics and carbon transport technology:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MUST (Multiphase flow in Steeply inclined pipes)</strong>: Investigating flow regimes in high-pressure pipelines with the goal of developing scaling laws for performance metrics like pressure drop and holdup. My work includes dimensional analysis, experimental design, and real-time data acquisition using sensors and flow imaging.</li>
        <li><strong>ENCASE (Experimental investigation of CO₂ blowdown)</strong>: Conducting research in France to understand the formation of dry ice during blowdown events. I focus on how impurities influence the triple point of CO₂ mixtures using precision measurements and optical diagnostics.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Past Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Before my current PhD work, I was involved in smaller research initiatives bridging wave mechanics, elasticity, and porous media flow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wave–Structure Interaction</strong>: Modeled the interactions between gravity waves and flexible elastic membranes floating on the ocean surface, exploring their dynamic stability and response under wave forcing.</li>
        <li><strong>PoreLab Methodology Development</strong>: Designed a particle tracking and velocimetry (PIV/PTV) method for studying multiphase flow in porous media, contributing to ongoing PoreLab research at UiO.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Across all projects, I employ tools such as Python, MATLAB, OpenFOAM, and high-speed imaging systems, alongside Coriolis and ultrasound flow meters, pressure/temperature sensors, and advanced diagnostics like gamma densitometry and x-ray imaging.
