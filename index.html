      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my summer project focused on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) 
        in multiphase flow in porous media.</p>

        The UiO:Energy and Environment Initiative funds research projects within the field of energy, climate and environment.
        This project was proposed and supervised by researchers at PoreLab and the Njord Centre (Departments of Physics and Geosciences).
        Fluids flow through porous media, like soils, river beds, and rocks, carrying molecules, bacteria, and particles that impact 
        various environmental and energy processes, from carbon dioxide sequestration to groundwater remediation. While single-fluid flows 
        (e.g., air or water) in porous media are well-understood, our ability to predict multi-fluid flows (e.g., air and water together) 
        remains limited. This project aims to enhance our understanding of fluid dynamics in porous media through laboratory experiments.
        In this project, we used stereolithography 3D printing to create transparent model porous media, and imaging of fluorescent 
        particles to measure fluid velocities. 
        This website presents the work that was accomplished and attests to the efforts made during the project.
